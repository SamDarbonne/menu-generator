# Menu Generator

inspired by [Py Fieri](https://github.com/nficano/pyfieri). Mostly an excercise in shipping a simple chrome extension.

## Development
### Installation
1. `npm install`

### Build / Deploy
1. `npm run build`
2. Go to chrome "Manage Extensions"
3. Hit "Load Unpacked" (once installed, update will suffice for loading changes)
4. Upload dist folder
